## Sample parser (JFlex + Cup)

An adaptation of the [CUP calculator example](http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/examples.php)
that uses a lexer generated by [JFlex](https://jflex.de), built via [Gradle](https://gradle.org).

Example project for the **Formal Languages and Compilers** course
(M.D. in Computer Science Engineering) at the [Polytechnic University of Bari](http://www.poliba.it).
